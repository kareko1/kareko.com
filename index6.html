<B>ABOUT ME</B>
</head>
<p>My name is Brian Kareko ive been to Moringa School and taken Software Development .The course is  really
   interestingwhereby you get the chance to interact with a webpages content.The main reason why I joined Moringa School is
   because i had a passion and a goal of becoming a software development "heavyweight".I am also a reseacher on
    different recipes and even trying them out.I also have an passion for music my hobbies are:</p>
       <ul>

    
       <h5> <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <li>cooking</li>
        <li>playing basketall</li>
        <li>trying out new recipes</li>
        <p>On top of that i am really fascinated with  the seven wonders of the world specifically the WILDBEAST MIGRATION accross RIVER MARA .It is my favourite  mainly because my motherland is involved.
        Another reason is that no one can explain the imbalance of the echo system and the interdependence between the wildbeasts and the crocodiles which are the dominant dwellers of the mara river.Crocodiles are very fascinating reptiles with a mature crocodile believed to have 66 teeth 33 on the lower jaw and 33 on the upper jaw
        My spirit animal is an eagle,this is so because eagle are a captivating species of bird known to possess extreme survival instincts not to mention their vission.In addittion to that eagles are independent birds that dont rely on dead prey but strive to hunt them down themselves.That is the personal challenge i get from the eagle.
        </ul> </h5>
